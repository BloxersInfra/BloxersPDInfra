Hi! This is a simple Discord x PagerDuty integration that allows teams to page on-call members during emergencies. 

# Usage 

Team Members will say /pagepteam or /pagePTeam which will initiate a call using PagerDuty's API Service. 

# Requirements 

You'll need to create a .env file containing the required API Keys for PagerDuty and Discord before deploying to a third-party service or hosting locally on your machine.
